# Phosphorus

**Phosphorus** is a digital hallucinogen and a container for subconscious projection. It invites users to light a virtual match and speak to the flame.

As you speak, your voice drives a psychedelic, fluid-simulated background ("The Subconscious"), while the pixel-art matchstick ("The Reality Anchor") burns down in real-time.

## Features

- **Audio Reactivity**: The flame intensity and background visuals respond to microphone input.
- **Pixel Art Physics**: Custom Metaball/Threshold rendering for a "marker pen" hand-drawn fire aesthetic.
- **LSD Dream Emulator Style**: Low-res, high-saturation fluid dynamics inspired by retro glitch art.
- **Generative Poetry**: Upon burnout, the app generates a "residue" card capturing the mood of the session.
